Welcome to my personal CV website. 

This site is made with Azure static web apps - Free for personal use, but the code is hosted using GitHub, hence this is here. 

I suggest you head over to https://bryce.id.au rather than spending your time here.


# Vanilla JavaScript App


[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) allows you to easily build JavaScript apps in minutes. Use this repo with the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=vanilla-javascript) to build and customize a new static site.

This repo is used as a starter for a _very basic_ HTML web application using no front-end frameworks.
